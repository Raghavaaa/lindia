# üéØ REAL ISSUE FOUND - Frontend API Path Wrong!

## The Problem:

Your frontend is configured to call:
```
/api/v1/clients
```

But your backend actually has:
```
/clients/
```

**They don't match!** That's why the frontend never connected to PostgreSQL!

---

## What I Just Fixed:

Updated `frontend/src/lib/config.ts`:
```typescript
// BEFORE (wrong):
clients: '/api/v1/clients',

// AFTER (correct):
clients: '/clients',
```

---

## What This Means:

Your frontend was calling a non-existent endpoint!
- It failed to connect
- Fell back to localStorage
- Never touched the database

Now it will call the CORRECT endpoint and save to PostgreSQL!

---

## Next Steps:

1. The frontend needs to be redeployed with this fix
2. OR if you're running locally, just restart the dev server
3. Then clients will save to the database!

---

## This Explains Everything:

- ‚úÖ Backend IS working (we saw Swagger works)
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI works (localStorage fallback)
- ‚ùå They weren't connected (wrong API path)
- ‚úÖ NOW THEY WILL BE! (path fixed)

JWT was a red herring - the real issue was the API path mismatch!
