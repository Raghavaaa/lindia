✅ CORS FIX - DEPLOYED TO RAILWAY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:

The backend was blocking requests from "https://www.legalindia.ai"

Added to CORS allowed origins:
  ✅ https://www.legalindia.ai (NEW - this fixes your issue!)
  ✅ https://legalindia.ai (already there)
  ✅ http://localhost:3000 (for local testing)
  ✅ http://localhost:3001 (for local testing)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏳ DEPLOYMENT STATUS:

Railway is deploying the backend now...
This will take 1-2 minutes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 AFTER DEPLOYMENT (IN 2 MINUTES):

1. Go back to: https://www.legalindia.ai/app
2. Hard refresh: Cmd + Shift + R
3. Create test client:
   - Name: "CORS Fix Test"
   - Email: "cors@test.com"
   - Phone: "7777777777"
4. Tell me "done"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT TO EXPECT:

NO MORE CORS ERRORS! ✅
The Network tab should show:
  ✅ POST to https://api.legalindia.ai/clients/
  ✅ Status: 201 Created
  ✅ No red CORS errors

Then I'll verify the client is in PostgreSQL database!

⏰ WAIT 2 MINUTES FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

Then test again! 🚀
