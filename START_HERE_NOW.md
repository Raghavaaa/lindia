## 💡 Why AI Engine Needs Manual Deployment

The AI engine deployment requires:
- Browser login to Railway
- GitHub OAuth authentication  
- Manual repository selection
- Environment variable configuration

I can't do these steps programmatically, so **you need to do this part manually**.

**But don't worry!** I've created a complete step-by-step guide in `DEPLOY_NOW.md`.
