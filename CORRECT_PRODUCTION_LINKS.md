# ✅ CORRECT Production API Links - api.legalindia.ai

Based on your Swagger UI, here are the **CORRECT** endpoint URLs:

## 🔗 Working Production Links:

### ✅ No Auth Required:

1. **Health Check:**
   ```
   https://api.legalindia.ai/
   ```

2. **Database Status:**
   ```
   https://api.legalindia.ai/db-status
   ```

3. **API Documentation (Swagger):**
   ```
   https://api.legalindia.ai/docs
   ```
   ✅ This is working! You can see all endpoints here.

### 🔐 Client Endpoints (Check Swagger for exact paths):

The client endpoints should be visible in your Swagger UI at:
https://api.legalindia.ai/docs

**Common patterns to check:**

Option 1 (with /api/v1/ prefix):
```
https://api.legalindia.ai/api/v1/clients/
```

Option 2 (direct /clients/ path):
```
https://api.legalindia.ai/clients/
```

**How to find the correct path:**
1. Go to: https://api.legalindia.ai/docs
2. Look for "Client Management" section
3. The exact path will be shown there
4. Click "Try it out" to test directly!

## 🎯 Recommended: Use Swagger UI

Since your Swagger UI is working perfectly, use it for testing:

1. **Open:** https://api.legalindia.ai/docs
2. **Generate Token:**
   ```bash
   cd legalindia-backend
   python3 generate_token.py
   ```
3. **Authorize in Swagger:**
   - Click green "Authorize" button
   - Enter: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
   - Click "Authorize" then "Close"
4. **Test endpoints** with "Try it out" buttons!

## 📋 What Your Swagger Shows:

From your screenshot, I can see these sections:
- **default** - Health check, db-status
- **File Upload** - Upload endpoints
- **Schemas** - Data models

Look for **"Client Management"** section in the Swagger UI to see the exact client endpoint paths!

---

## ✅ To Fix "Not Found" Error:

The client routes need the correct prefix. Check in Swagger UI under what path they're registered, or scroll through the docs to find the "Client" or "Client Management" section.
