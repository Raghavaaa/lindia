# âš¡ QUICK FIX - Run Frontend Locally (2 Minutes)

## ðŸŽ¯ THE PROBLEM:

**The deployed frontend (legalindia.ai) isn't updating.**

This could be:
- Cache issues
- Deployment not triggered
- Platform delay

**Instead of waiting, let's test locally to prove the code works!**

---

## âœ… FASTEST TEST (Run Frontend Locally):

### Step 1: Open Terminal & Run Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/raghavankarthik/ai-law-junior/frontend
npm run dev
```

**This will:**
- Start local dev server
- Use the NEW code (with API key integration)
- Open at: http://localhost:3000

### Step 2: Open in Browser

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/app**
2. Create a test client:
   - Name: "Local Test Client"
   - Email: "local@test.com"
   - Phone: "6666666666"
3. Click Create

### Step 3: I'll Check Database

Tell me "done" and I'll check if "Local Test Client" is in PostgreSQL!

## ðŸ’¡ WHY THIS WORKS:

**Local = Uses your latest code directly**
- No deployment needed âœ…
- No cache issues âœ…
- Instant testing âœ…

**If it works locally:**
- Your code is correct âœ…
- Just a deployment/cache issue with legalindia.ai
- Can fix that separately

---

## ðŸš€ RUN THIS NOW:

```bash
cd /Users/raghavankarthik/ai-law-junior/frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000/app**

Create "Local Test Client" and tell me!

**This will prove the code works in < 2 minutes!** âš¡
