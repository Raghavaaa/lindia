# 🔧 FIX DEPLOYED FRONTEND - Direct Solution

## 🎯 THE ISSUE:

Your deployed frontend at **legalindia.ai** is not using the API key integration code.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Add Environment Variable to Deployment

Your frontend needs the API key to be set as an environment variable!

### **The Missing Piece:**

The frontend `config.ts` has this:
```typescript
apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY || 'legalindia_secure_api_key_2025'
```

But your deployment platform might not have `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` set!

---

## 🚀 FIX IT NOW:

### **Option 1: If Using Vercel**

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click your project (lindia or legalindia)
3. Click **"Settings"** tab
4. Click **"Environment Variables"** in left sidebar
5. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `legalindia_secure_api_key_2025`
   - **Environments:** Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
6. Click **"Save"**
7. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
8. Click **"Redeploy"** on latest deployment
9. Wait 2-3 minutes

### **Option 2: If Using Netlify**

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com**
2. Click your site
3. Click **"Site settings"**
4. Click **"Environment variables"** (or "Build & deploy" → "Environment")
5. Click **"Add a variable"**
6. Add:
   - **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `legalindia_secure_api_key_2025`
7. Click **"Save"**
8. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
9. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**
10. Wait for build to complete

### **Option 3: If Using Railway**

1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Select your frontend service
3. Click **"Variables"** tab
4. Click **"New Variable"**
5. Add:
   - **Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `legalindia_secure_api_key_2025`
6. Click **"Deploy"** or wait for auto-redeploy

---

## 🧪 AFTER ADDING VARIABLE & REDEPLOYING:

### Wait 2-3 minutes, then:

1. **Hard refresh:** Cmd + Shift + R
2. **OR try incognito:** Cmd + Shift + N
3. Go to: **legalindia.ai/app**
4. Create test client:
   - Name: "ENV VAR Test"
   - Email: "envvar@test.com"
   - Phone: "5555555555"
5. Tell me "done"

I'll check if it's in the database!

---

## 💡 WHY THIS MIGHT BE THE ISSUE:

**Without the environment variable:**
- Frontend code exists ✅
- But `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` is undefined
- Falls back to hardcoded value... which should still work 🤔

**Actually, let me check something else...**

## 🔍 ALTERNATIVE ISSUE: Wrong Branch Deployed

### Check if Your Deployment is Using the Correct Branch:

**In your deployment platform:**
1. Check which branch is being deployed
2. Should be: **"integration"** branch
3. If it's "main" or "master" → Change it to "integration"

**How to check/change in Vercel:**
1. Settings → Git
2. Look at "Production Branch"
3. Should be: `integration`
4. If not, change it and redeploy

**How to check/change in Netlify:**
1. Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous deployment
2. Look at "Branch"
3. Should be: `integration`
4. If not, change it and redeploy

---

## 🎯 MOST LIKELY CAUSES:

### Cause 1: Environment Variable Not Set
**Fix:** Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` to deployment platform

### Cause 2: Wrong Branch Being Deployed
**Fix:** Change production branch to `integration`

### Cause 3: Build Failed Silently
**Fix:** Check deployment logs for errors

### Cause 4: Service Worker Caching
**Fix:** Clear site data completely
