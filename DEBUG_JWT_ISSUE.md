# üêõ Debug: JWT Token Still Invalid

## Current Situation:
- ‚úÖ Railway JWT_SECRET updated to: `uH0bhpcWCEH0IeO8YqUGHcLm3vScV5INtpIzLZxgnG2e3M_GkHfDuwcdRtH9jLFx`
- ‚úÖ Local JWT_SECRET: `uH0bhpcWCEH0IeO8YqUGHcLm3vScV5INtpIzLZxgnG2e3M_GkHfDuwcdRtH9jLFx`
- ‚úÖ Backend is running (health check works)
- ‚úÖ Database connected
- ‚ùå Tokens still showing "Invalid token"

## Possible Issues:

### 1. Railway hasn't fully redeployed yet
- Check: Go to Railway ‚Üí Deployments tab
- Look for: "Active" status on latest deployment
- If still "Building" or "Deploying", wait 1-2 more minutes

### 2. Railway might be caching old environment
- Try: Manual redeploy in Railway
- Go to: Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"

### 3. Check Railway Logs
```bash
# If you have Railway CLI:
railway logs
```

Look for errors related to JWT_SECRET or token validation.

## Quick Test:

Let's try creating a token with the EXACT secret Railway should have:

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

SECRET = "uH0bhpcWCEH0IeO8YqUGHcLm3vScV5INtpIzLZxgnG2e3M_GkHfDuwcdRtH9jLFx"

payload = {
    "sub": "test_user_123",
    "user_id": "test_user_123",
    "iat": datetime.utcnow(),
    "email": "test_user_123@test.com",
    "test": True,
    "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=30)
}

token = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET, algorithm="HS256")
print("Token:", token)
```

## Alternative: Check if Railway is using a different JWT_SECRET

Go to Railway ‚Üí lindia-b ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Click on JWT_SECRET

Make SURE it shows:
```
uH0bhpcWCEH0IeO8YqUGHcLm3vScV5INtpIzLZxgnG2e3M_GkHfDuwcdRtH9jLFx
```

Not:
```
your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-12345
```

## Next Steps:

1. Check Railway Deployments tab - is the latest one "Active"?
2. Check Railway Variables - does JWT_SECRET match?
3. Try manual redeploy if needed
4. Check Railway logs for JWT errors
