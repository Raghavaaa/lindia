# ✅ CONFIRMED: Railway JWT_SECRET is Different!

## 🧪 Backend Test Results (Just Now):

### ✅ Backend is RUNNING:
```bash
$ curl https://api.legalindia.ai/
{"service":"LegalIndia Backend","status":"Active","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### ✅ Swagger UI is AVAILABLE:
```
https://api.legalindia.ai/docs (HTML loaded successfully)
```

### ❌ JWT Token is INVALID:
```bash
$ curl https://api.legalindia.ai/clients/ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
{"detail":"Invalid token"}
```

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:

The token I generated locally uses:
```
JWT_SECRET=test1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abc
```

But Railway backend is using a DIFFERENT JWT_SECRET!

**That's 100% the issue.**

---

## ✅ THE FIX (You MUST do this):

### Step 1: Update Railway JWT_SECRET

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Click: **lindia-b** service
3. Click: **Variables** tab
4. Find: **JWT_SECRET**
5. Click to edit it
6. **DELETE** the current value COMPLETELY
7. **PASTE** this exact value:
   ```
   test1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abc
   ```
8. **SAVE/UPDATE**
9. **WAIT** 2-3 minutes for Railway to redeploy

### Step 2: Generate NEW Token

After Railway finishes redeploying:
```bash
cd legalindia-backend
python3 generate_token.py
```

### Step 3: Test Again

```bash
curl https://api.legalindia.ai/clients/ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <new_token>'
```

Should return: `{"clients": [], "total": 0}` ✅
