# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide for LegalIndia.ai

This guide will help you deploy your LegalIndia.ai application on Railway.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Railway account ([railway.app](https://railway.app))
- GitHub repository connected to Railway
- DeepSeek API key

## üöÄ Quick Deploy

### Step 1: Create New Project on Railway

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your `lindia` repository

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard, go to **Variables** and add the following:

#### Required Variables

```bash
# DeepSeek API Key (REQUIRED)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Frontend Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_API_BASE=/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_ENV=production
```

#### Optional Variables

```bash
# Admin Secret (for admin operations)
ADMIN_SECRET=your_secure_admin_secret

# Custom Prompt Base
PROMPT_BASE=Refine and clarify the legal research query for Indian law.

# Hugging Face Token (if needed)
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect Next.js application
2. Run `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
3. Start the application with `npm start`
4. Assign a public URL

## üîß Configuration Details

### Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm ci --include=dev && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 5
  }
}
```

### Health Check Endpoint

The application exposes a health check at `/api/health`:

```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "deepseek": "configured"
  },
  "memory": {
    "used": 120,
    "total": 512,
    "unit": "MB"
  }
}
```

## üìä Monitoring

### View Logs

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click on the service
3. Navigate to **"Logs"** tab

### Log Format

The application uses structured logging:

```
[2025-10-15T10:30:00.000Z] POST /api/research - 200 - 1234ms
[Research] Processing query (234 chars) for client: ABC Corp
[DeepSeek] API call successful
```

### Health Monitoring

Railway automatically monitors the `/api/health` endpoint:
- **Healthy**: Returns 200 status
- **Unhealthy**: Returns 500 status
- **Timeout**: No response within 100 seconds

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to Git
- ‚úÖ Use Railway's secure environment variable storage
- ‚úÖ Rotate API keys periodically

### 2. Security Headers
The application includes security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 3. API Rate Limiting
Consider adding rate limiting for production:
- Use Railway's built-in rate limiting
- Or implement custom rate limiting middleware

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### 1. Build Optimization
- Uses `npm ci` for faster, deterministic installs
- Standalone output mode for smaller deployments
- SWC minification for faster builds

### 2. Runtime Optimization
- Compression enabled
- Image optimization (AVIF, WebP)
- API response caching headers

### 3. Memory Management
- Monitor memory usage via `/api/health`
- Default Railway memory limit: 512MB
- Can be increased in Railway settings if needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue**: Build command fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if all dependencies are in package.json
npm install

# Verify build works locally
npm run build

# Check Railway build logs for specific errors
```

### DeepSeek API Errors

**Issue**: "Service not properly configured"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is set in Railway variables
2. Check API key validity
3. View logs for detailed error messages

### Health Check Failing

**Issue**: Railway shows service as unhealthy

**Solutions**:
1. Check `/api/health` endpoint manually
2. Verify application is starting correctly
3. Check for startup errors in logs
4. Ensure PORT environment variable is being used

### Memory Issues

**Issue**: Application crashes due to memory

**Solutions**:
1. Monitor memory via `/api/health`
2. Increase memory limit in Railway settings
3. Optimize API response sizes
4. Implement response streaming for large results

## üìà Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (Increase Resources)
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to Settings
2. Adjust **Memory** and **CPU** limits
3. Redeploy

### Horizontal Scaling (Multiple Instances)
Update `railway.json`:
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 2
  }
}
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

Railway automatically deploys when you push to main branch:

1. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "feat: update"`
2. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`
3. **Railway auto-deploys**: Monitor in dashboard

### Manual Deployment

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click **"Deploy"**
3. Select specific commit or branch

## üìû Support

### Railway Issues
- Railway Discord: [discord.gg/railway](https://discord.gg/railway)
- Railway Docs: [docs.railway.app](https://docs.railway.app)

### Application Issues
- Check application logs in Railway
- Review health check endpoint
- Verify environment variables

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Set up custom domain in Railway
2. ‚úÖ Configure SSL (automatic with Railway)
3. ‚úÖ Set up monitoring alerts
4. ‚úÖ Add database for research history (PostgreSQL)
5. ‚úÖ Implement Redis caching for API responses
6. ‚úÖ Add authentication with NextAuth.js

## üìù Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] DeepSeek API key verified
- [ ] Health check endpoint tested
- [ ] Application builds successfully locally
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Logging working correctly
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] API endpoints tested
- [ ] Frontend routes working
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)

## üåê Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test the application**: Visit your Railway URL
2. **Check health**: `curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
3. **Test research**: Try a legal research query
4. **Monitor logs**: Check Railway dashboard logs
5. **Set up alerts**: Configure Railway notifications
